### EE 587 students:
Design a waveguide structure that consists of at least 4 layers using materials other than GaAs/AlGaAs. The waveguide should achieve confinement for both x- and y-direction for a wavelength of your choice. It does not need to be a ridge waveguide. Draw your waveguide structure and include the refractive indices of the materials. Write a program to solve the effective index of the waveguide and plot the electric field profile in both x- and y-distribution.
